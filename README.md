# Crowd Control Protocol (CCP)

A little app that controls the inflow and outflow of students by scanning QR tags on entry and exit.

Made to ease up student entry/exit into our gaming lounge during Open House 2023 @ CSE AJCE.

On each QR scan, a student is assigned to whichever games they want to play, and the same is checked out while they exit.

Made with ❤️ using React Native and Firebase.
